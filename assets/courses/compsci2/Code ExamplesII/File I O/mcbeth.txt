tomorrow tomorrow and tommorow
creep in this petty place from day to day
to the last sylable of recorded time
and all our yesterdays have lighted candles this way to dusty death
out out brief candle
life is but a walking shadow
a poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage
and then is heard no more 
i is a tale told by an idiot
full of sound and fury
signifying nothing

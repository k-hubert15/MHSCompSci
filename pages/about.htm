">What is Computer Science ?</h2>

<p>Computer Science is the study of how computational algorithms work. Computer science deals with the concepts and processes behind what computers do. It is NOT about to use different programs. In the course of study, one may develop a proficiency with using computers, but that is not the goal.</p>

<h2 class="page-header-bottom">Courses Available (from the school course catalog)</h2>

<h3>Computer Science I</h2>
<p>Computer Science 1 is open to all students. The course introduces the student to the computer programming using the Visual Basic language in a Windows environment. Applications are taken from among the topics of mathematics (geometry, algebra, probability, and statistics), business (payroll, inventory, personnel records, and financial analysis), education (grading programs), graphics, and games. The course focuses on the computer as an important tool in problem solving, while developing critical thinking skills.</p>


<h3>Computer Science II</h2>
<p>Computer Science 2 is a full year course covering computer programming using the Java programming language. This course utilizes object-oriented principles. Emphasis is placed on the problem solving approach featuring algorithm development and top-down design. This is a "hands-on" course with the student writing programs to solve mathematical and practical problems.</p>


<h3>Advanced Placement Computer Science</h2>
<p>This course conforms to the topics presented in the syllabus provided by the College Board Entrance Examination Board. The major emphases are on programming methodology, algorithms, and data structures. Applications of computing provide the context in which these subjects are treated. Other topics included are programming languages. Criteria for admission include a superior grade average, a high score on the qualifying test, and outstanding teacher recommendations. Students are required to take the Advanced Placement Exam in May.</p>
